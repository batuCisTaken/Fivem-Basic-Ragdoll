## Fivem-Basic-Ragdoll
-Basic ragdoll script for fivem.

## How it works / Features
-Default ragdoll key is 'U' and stop ragdoll key is 'E'  
-You can change the keys from config file I've wrote key indexes and what you need to change  
-You can change the message that will display when ragdoll is on from config file  
-It doesn't work if player is in a car or entering a car (I did this on purpose)  

## How to add to your server
-Go to your server's resource folder (e.g. C:\FxServer\server-data\resources) paste there the folder  
-Open server.cfg and start the script with its name whatever you set if you didn't change the folder name just start with folder's default name
